        <h3>Born on July in the year 2010 to a single mother and a ghost father, I find that forgivness isn't always the answer.
             My name is Empress I Lanclos but most people call me Emi.
              Most Gen Z kids have an normal life when their parents get them anything they want and they can just go out on their own time scocializing and having a great time.  
              I manly spent my time indoors away from the world, reading, whatching anime, cleaning, or sleeping. franly the only time I went out was if I had to go to the store, visit family, or if my parents were tired of 
              breathing the same air.

        <h3>I don't have one yet but I would like to re-do my room. I am going for a earthy asthetic Gibli themed room. I used to play soccer but i had to stop becuase it was getting to time consuming. I love to draw sing. Somtimes I have reality crisis becuase I think to much about life. TwT! 
            My favorite color is purple. Demon Slayer has to be my favorit anime, I read all of the books I just need to finish the seiries when it comes out. 
            Other than that I like to watch K-Dramas, I don't really remember when I got into them I just did. I love to read mangas I used to read them all the time in middle school. I don't read as much of them anymore because we don't have a variety of them but I enjoy requesting some when I can.

My perents said they were going to get me and my lil-sis our own phone that isn't going to be so out-dataed.
